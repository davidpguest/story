# story
Some attempts to produce a narrative using algorithmic approaches. The idea is to generate something that is readable and coherent, while allowing as much improvisation as possible on the part of the machines.

Version 1 has basic elements of building sentences, etc, and could happily carry on for ever although it would be repetitive after a short time. Version 2 is an attempt to get closer to a coherent narrative but introducing character arcs, and more variation in the narrative style. This will only produce a limited number of words but is more likely to produce something that feels like an actual story.
